# Oden

Bot for Slack to select reviewers.  
If you send the URL of PR to Bot, we will pick two reviewers and add them to Assignees of Github.

## Features

- Use the Slack API and Github API.
- Randomly select 2 online users for review channel.
- Correspondence table of Slack and Github ID is obtained by team.json of Git.
- Adjust so as not to consecutively make the same person reviewer.
